## Introduction - Tools to Use

1. Java Development Kit
2. IDE (Eclipse, Intellij IDEA, VS Code)
3. Maven

First thing, you go to [JDK Download link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) and download the correct package.
After, you need an IDE. For this course, can use Eclipse.

Another thing that you need is Apache Maven package. You can download it on [Apache Maven Download link](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

Another thing to do is to add the environment variables for **JAVA_HOME** and **M2_HOME** so that we can use the **java** and **mvn** command with the terminal from anywhere on our machine (Windows or Linux)
